**Years:** 2022-2024                      **Location**: Uppsala, Sweden

**In collaboration with**: Uppsala University, Northern Arizona University's [Playful Health Technology Lab](https://www.phtlab.nau.edu/), KTH Royal Institute of Technology and Umeå University.

Movement sensing technologies have opened up physical rehabilitation and training to the inclusion of modern machine learning (ML) techniques for personalization. The paramount standard for evaluating the success of a ML model has long been its predictive power and accuracy, but even a gold-standard accuracy benchmark fails when it inappropriately misrepresents disabled and minority bodies, and people with diverse physical capabilities. 

In MovAI, we sought to critically examine and reframe the roles of ML for physical rehabilitation through two case studies. In the first case study, we engaged in a participatory work co-creating exergames by employing ML and its training as a source of play and motivation rather than an accurate diagnostic tool for children with and without sensory based motor disorders. In the second case study, we explored the potential of ML to be used in physiotherapy in ways that do not aim at replacing the physiotherapist's expertise, but rather leverage and enhance the relational aspects of the practice.

Through both case studies, we articulated visions for future ML development rooted in collaborative efforts to attune knowledge and technologies to the complexities of afflicted bodies and their lived experiences -- towards promoting sustainable health futures and human flourishing.
