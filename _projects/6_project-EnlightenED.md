Vision is one of the most predominant senses, people are highly skilled at, and used to, understanding diverse visual input (including movement, light, shape, and color). Interactive technologies offer the possibility of visualizing elusive body aspects (such as movement qualities, heart rate, and so on), in ways that go above and beyond the information that is otherwise available to us.

Enlighten(ed) encompasses a collection of different design experiments that I engaged with during my PhD. These experiments explored the potential of augmenting movement qualities through visual feedback, with the goal of improving movement teaching & learning. The experiments combined interaction design and movement pedagogy, with a strong participatory design approach involving a variety of movement experts as co-designers. Situated in different practices of movement teaching and learning (i.e. yoga, strength training, home exercise, fast-paced fitness activities), 

Enlighten(ed) produced as design outcomes both a variety of design artefacts (e.g. visual feedback wearables, visual cues in instructional videos) and the (re)design of movement teaching and learning activities to include the artefacts in them in meaningful ways. It also helped articulate the strong concept [Intercorporeal Biofeedback](https://doi.org/10.1145/3582428). 

The designs in Enlighten(ed) improved movement teaching & learning in manifold ways: they enriched people's aesthetic perception of bodies in motion, improved the communication and understanding between teachers and students, and helped students' performance and their overall understanding of the movement practice.
