**Years:** 2017-2021     **Location**: Uppsala University, Sweden

**In collaboration with**: Hui Zhu (Personal Trainer), Chris Boyer Yoga and Movement therapy, Alessandra Semeraro, [MovIntPlayLab](https://movintplaylab.com/), Annika Waern (PhD supervisor)

Physical activity (PA) is a key area within health tech research. A core strategy to promote PA is to support people in engaging in, and learning, existing PA practices. Enlighten(ed) comprises design experiments conducted during my PhD that aimed to enhance movement education and embodied learning by integrating interaction design and movement pedagogy. 

Through these experiments, I explored how interactive visual technologies could meaningfully augment qualities of our body (for example, movements, alignment, breathing, and so forth), making us become aware of them beyond our usual sensory capabilities. The experiments foregrounded the role of community and collective knowledge in PA research, inviting practitioners and experts from diverse somatic practices (e.g. yoga, strength training, home exercises, and fast-paced fitness activities) as co-designers. Further, I focused on the design of technologies that respected and did justice to the plurality of bodies in the PA practices at focus.

Enlighten(ed) produced as design outcomes both various design artifacts (including visual feedback wearables, or instructional videos augmented through visual cues) and their integration into (re)designed embodied education activities. It also helped articulate the strong concept [Intercorporeal Biofeedback](https://doi.org/10.1145/3582428). These designs significantly improved PA education in manifold ways: by enriching aesthetic perceptions of bodies in motion, improving communication between teachers and students, and enhancing students' performance and understanding of their own PA practices.
