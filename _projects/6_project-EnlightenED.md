**Years:** 2017-2021     **Location**: Uppsala University, Sweden

**In collaboration with**: Hui Zhu (Personal Trainer), Chris Boyer Yoga and Movement therapy, Alessandra Semeraro, [MovIntPlayLab](https://movintplaylab.com/), Annika Waern (PhD supervisor)

Enlighten(ed) comprises design experiments conducted during my PhD. These experiments explored how interactive visual technologies can augment subtle aspects of our body, making us aware of them beyond our usual sensory capabilities.

The experiments aimed to enhance movement education by integrating interaction design and movement pedagogy. They all employed a strong participatory design approach, inviting experts from diverse practices (e.g. yoga, strength training, home exercise, and fast-paced fitness activities) as co-designers.

Enlighten(ed) produced as design outcomes both various design artifacts (including visual feedback wearables, or instructional videos augmented through visual cues) and their integration into (re)designed movement education activities. It also helped articulate the strong concept [Intercorporeal Biofeedback](https://doi.org/10.1145/3582428). 

The designs in Enlighten(ed) significantly improved movement education in manifold ways: by enriching aesthetic perceptions of bodies in motion, improving communication between teachers and students, and enhancing students' performance and understanding of movement practices.
