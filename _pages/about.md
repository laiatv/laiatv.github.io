Hello, I am Laia. I do research at the intersection of Interaction Design, body experiences and health & wellbeing. In particular, I investigate multisensory technologies that can enrich people's body perception (through e.g. sensory augmentations, or alterations) to promote physical, emotional and social wellbeing. 

I have designed, deployed and evaluated technologies in multiple settings of health and wellbeing, such as sports, fitness practices, rehabilitation, exergames, functional exercises, or professional dance. My research interests include wearable computing, personalization, material interactions, participatory design and soma design methods. 

I hold a PhD and MSc in Human Computer Interaction (Uppsala University, Sweden) and a BDes in Multimedia Technologies (Polytechnic University of Catalunya, Spain). I am currently a Digital Future's Postdoc Researcher at KTH Royal Institute of Technology (Sweden). Previously, I was a postdoc at i_mBODY Lab (Madrid, Spain) and a research visitor at University College London Interaction Center (UK).

Besides research, I enjoy [drawing and photoembroidery](https://www.instagram.com/laia.trmvdl/), sports and spending time walking and foraging the forests of Sweden. Get in contact with me through:
