Hello, I am Laia. My research is concerned with Interaction Design for health and wellbeing, and I specialize in designing and implementing interactive sensorimotor technologies. These technologies enrich people's sensory and motor abilities through digital innovation, facilitating new and unique engagements with oneself, others, and the world.

As the technologies and interactions we design deeply influence our bodily experiences, my research also involves carefully exploring and designing the integration of these technologies into people's everyday lives. The overarching aim of my research is to promote people's physical, emotional, and social wellbeing - all of which ultimately contribute to people's overall quality of life.

I have designed, deployed and evaluated sensorimotor technologies in multiple domains of health and wellbeing, such as sports, fitness practices, rehabilitation, exergames, physical inactivity, or professional dance. My research interests include wearable computing, personalization, material interactions, participatory design and soma design methods.

I hold a PhD and MSc in Human Computer Interaction (Uppsala University, Sweden) and a BDes in Multimedia Technologies (Polytechnic University of Catalunya, Spain). I am currently a Digital Future's Postdoc Researcher at KTH Royal Institute of Technology (Sweden). Previously, I was a postdoc at i_mBODY Lab (Madrid, Spain) and a research visitor at University College London Interaction Center (UK).

Besides research, I enjoy [drawing and photoembroidery](https://www.instagram.com/laia.trmvdl/), physical activity, and spending time walking and foraging the forests of Sweden. Get in contact with me through:
