Hello, I am Laia. I investigate novel sensorial and body-centred interactive paradigms for health and well-being. In particular, I focus on the design of emerging interactive technologies that **enrich** and **transform** the experience that we have of our bodies, leveraging them to drive positive physical, emotional and social effects.

I have explored, designed, implemented and evaluated interactive technologies such as wearables that utilize sensory feedback loops, immersive mixed-reality environments and, more recently, shape-changing materials. I have worked extensively in contexts of sports, fitness, physical rehabilitation and professional dance, with different populations. My research utilizes design approaches such as Research through Design, Participatory Design, and Soma Design. Theoretically, my design work is often informed by theories such as feminism and phenomenology. 

My broader research interests include tangible, embedded and embodied technology, material interactions, body perception, and the development of methodologies that center the human body and movement in design.

I hold a PhD and MSc in Human Computer Interaction (Uppsala University, Sweden) and a BSc in Multimedia Technologies (Polytechnic University of Catalunya, Spain). I am currently a Digital Futureâ€™s Postdoc Researcher at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. Previously, I was a postdoc in an ERC-CoG grant at i_mBODY Lab (Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Spain) and a research visitor at University College London Interaction Center (UK).

Besides research, I enjoy [drawing and photoembroidery](https://www.instagram.com/laia.trmvdl/), physical activity, and spending time walking and foraging the forests of Sweden. Get in contact with me through:
