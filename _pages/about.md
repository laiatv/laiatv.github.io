**Hello! I am Laia, and I explore body-centered interactive technologies and approaches to design for health and wellbeing.**

I focus on designing, developing, and studying innovative interactive systems that sense and actuate on the body, such as on-body devices and bio-reactive technologies. My premise is that these technologies can be designed to profoundly transform our somatic experiences, shaping our movements, self-perception, emotions and identity, as well as how we relate to each other. Thus, my work explores how we can responsibly design, deploy and evaluate such _somatic transformation technologies_ in ways that are conducive to individual and collective health, care and wellbeing.

My work combines Research through Design, material explorations and body-centered design methodologies. I am deeply committed to designing for body diversity, and to do so, I draw from embodiment theories such as phenomenology, feminism and post-humanism, and apply participatory and soma design methods. I am also deeply committed to positively contribute to peopleâ€™s life, in real-world settings. Thus, I have worked extensively on designing and deploying technological interventions in various health and wellbeing domains (including sports and fitness, rehabilitation, physical inactivity, and professional dance) through workshops, in-the-wild studies and long-term deployments.

Currently, I am exploring the potential of wearable systems to support people in processes of bodily transitions, such as experiencing physical injuries. 

My research interests include novel materials, body sensors and actuators, tangible technologies, design theory and knowledge, and the development of design methodologies that center the body and movement in design. Besides research, I enjoy [drawing and photoembroidery](https://www.instagram.com/laia.trmvdl/), physical activity and spending time walking and foraging the forests and lakes of Sweden.
