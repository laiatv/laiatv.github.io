**Hello! I am Laia, and I explore body-centered interactive technologies for health and wellbeing.**

I focus on designing, developing, and studying innovative interactive systems that sense and actuate on the body, such as wearable devices and bio-reactive technologies. My premise is that these technologies can be designed to profoundly transform our somatic experiences, shaping our movements, self-perception, emotions and identity, as well as how we relate to each other. Thus, my work explores how we can responsibly design, deploy and evaluate such _somatic transformation technologies_ in ways that are conducive to individual and collective health, care and wellbeing.

My work combines Research through Design, material explorations and body-centered design methodologies. I am deeply committed to designing for body diversity, and to do so, I draw from feminism and post-humanism discourses, and apply participatory and soma design methods. I am also deeply committed to positively contribute to peopleâ€™s life, in real-world settings. Thus, I have worked extensively on designing and deploying technological interventions in various health and wellbeing domains (including sports and fitness, rehabilitation, physical inactivity, and professional dance) through workshops, in-the-wild studies and long-term deployments.

In my past PhD work, I designed [intercorporeal biofeedback technologies](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3582428) to facilitate embodied teaching and learning in contexts of physical activity. During my first postdoc, I joined i_mBODY Lab as part of an ERC-CoG grant, where I exploited neuroscientific insights on body perception to design [sensorimotor transformations](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3623509.3633373) fostered by haptic and sound stimuli, and exploring their effects on people who are physically inactive and on professional dancers. Currently, I am a Digital Futures Postdoctoral Research Fellow at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, where I explore how to support self-care of health conditions through body-centred technologies that can positively impact people's relation with their bodies.

My research interests include novel materials, body sensors and actuators, personalization, design theory and knowledge, and the development of design methodologies that center the body and movement in design. Besides research, I enjoy [drawing and photoembroidery](https://www.instagram.com/laia.trmvdl/), physical activity and spending time walking and foraging the forests and lakes of Sweden.
