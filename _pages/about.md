**Hello! I am Laia, and I explore novel body-centered interactive paradigms to design for healthcare and well-being.**

My research investigates sensorimotor transformations facilitated by on-body systems and bio-responsive technologies. My premise is that the technologies we design _profoundly_ affect our somatic experiences, transforming our self perception and identity, our body and movements, our practices, our emotions, and our social functioning. I believe that designing these transformations through careful entanglements between the designed technologies, bodies, materials and practices can create novel and sustainable ways to foster physical, emotional and social care and well-being.

My work combines Research through Design, tangible technologies, material experiences and body-centered design methodologies. I am deeply committed to designing for a plurality of bodies, and to do so I draw from theories such as phenomenology, post-humanism and feminism, and apply participatory and soma design methods. I am also deeply committed to positively contribute to people's quality of life. Thus, I have worked extensively on designing digital interventions for various populations in everyday health and well-being domains, including sports and fitness, rehabilitation, physical inactivity, and professional dance.

Currently, I am exploring the potential of wearable systems to support people in processes of bodily transitions, such as experiencing physical injuries. 

My broader research interests include novel materials, body sensors and actuators, design theory and knowledge, and the development of design methodologies that center the body and movement in design. Besides research, I enjoy [drawing and photoembroidery](https://www.instagram.com/laia.trmvdl/), physical activity and spending time walking and foraging the forests and lakes of Sweden.
