Previously, I was a postdoc at i_mBODY Lab at the Department of Computer Science, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid (Spain), where I worked in an ERC-CoG project led by Assoc. Prof. Ana Tajadura-Jiménez.

I hold a PhD and MSc in Human Computer Interaction (Uppsala University, Sweden. PhD supervisor: Prof. Annika Waern). I have a BSc in Multimedia Technologies (Polytechnic University of Catalunya, Spain).
